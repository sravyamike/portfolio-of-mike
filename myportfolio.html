<hr>
<p style="font-size:20px">By discovering nature, you discover yourself.” –  Maxime Lagacé, A beautifully penned sentence. Nature is the entire physical world around us in a broad sense. It includes atmosphere, weather, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and landscapes. The beautiful environment around us who we call nature is the mother of all humans. It nurtures and nourishes us. It provides us with all the necessities to survive. Right from the food we eat, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear, and the houses we live in are the gift of nature. God has only gifted earth with nature, and we should be thankful for that.

<p style="margin-top:40px">Someone who is a true friend stands up for you. When others try to hurt you emotionally or physically, they do everything they can to make sure you stay safe. They don't care who is trying to harm you; they will defend you anytime, anywhere. If they can help you, they'll do it without reservation or reward. A true friend is not one who repeatedly is telling you negative things other people say about you. First, they make it clear by their words and by their actions where they stand when it comes to you. Secondly, they don't just merely standby silently when others are tearing you down no matter what consequences they may face socially. A true friend is a friend when is convenient and when it is not. They standby you consistently both when you are present and when you are not</p>
